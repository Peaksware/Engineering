# Engineering Principles and Practices
We believe in trust and decentralized decision making of autonomous team. Each team has "boots on the ground" and information that those outside the team _simply do not have_. Our principles come out of our collective experience as a group and support our engineering culture and guide our teams to make decisions that align with our business.

## Solve Business Concepts and Problems, Not Technical Ones
We strive for _pragmatic_ use of technology to solve a business problem. Technology will change and be replaced and sometimes the best solution to the problem does not involve technology.

## Simplify and Eliminate Unnecessary Complexity
It's easy to make something complex, but difficult to make it simple. We will actively seek to retire existing and prevent new unnecessary complexity.

## Reduce Inertia and Friction
We will reduce dependencies and bottlenecks and avoid coupling. We strive to automate as much as possible and incorporate feedback to allow others to improve independently.

## Operational Concerns are Built In
We will strive to know about problems before our customers do. We will not release code without security, monitoring, error and crash reporting built in.

## Performance is a Feature
We will consider the _appropriate_ level of scale and performance needed to delight our customers and only optimize what matters.

## Own It
We own our solution from conception to our customers hands. We strive to own critical parts of our business, core concepts and competencies.

## Consistent Interfaces and Data
We will create a clear system of record, behaviors and interactions and follow Postel's law:
> Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others
>                     -- Jon Postel

## No Silver Bullets
We understand that inertia, friction and accidental complexity can be created by looking for magic solutions. Third party solutions and bugs are _our_ bugs and we will isolate and marginalize the impact of required third party solutions.

## Think and Plan for Change, Implement the Need
We will consider future changes and scale when engineering a solution, but be pragmatic and not spend time on a perfect solution. We will deliver early and often to respond to feedback from our customers.
